This is a test application for the <A HREF="index.html">JavaScript library &quot;elizabot.js&quot;</A> (Norbert Landsteiner 2005; &lt;http://www.masswerk.at&gt;).<BR>
The test application should produce the original example given by Joseph Weizenbaum in his article on ELIZA from Jannuary 1966 <A HREF="#ELIZA">[1]</A>.<BR> Click &quot;Next step&quot; to see the next input und and Eliza's answer. Click &quot;Reset&quot; to reset Eliza and the display form.</TD>

<TD>
Men are all alike.<BR><BR>
IN WHAT WAY?<BR><BR>
They're always bugging us about something or other.<BR><BR>
CAN YOU THINK OF A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE?<BR><BR>
Well, my boyfriend made me come here.<BR><BR>
YOUR BOYFRIEND MADE YOU COME HERE?<BR><BR>
He says I'm depressed much of the time.<BR><BR>
I AM SORRY TO HEAR YOU ARE DEPRESSED.<BR><BR>
It's true.<BR>
I am unhappy.<BR><BR>
DO YOU THINK COMING HERE WILL HELP YOU NOT TO BE UNHAPPY.<BR><BR>
I need some help, that much seems certain.<BR><BR>
WHAT WOULD IT MEAN TO YOU IF YOU GOT SOME HELP?<BR><BR>
Perhaps I could learn to get along with my mother.<BR><BR>
TELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR FAMILY.<BR><BR>
My mother takes care of me.<BR><BR>
WHO ELSE IN YOUR FAMILY TAKES CARE OF YOU?<BR><BR>
My father.<BR><BR>
YOUR FATHER?<BR><BR>
You are like my father in some ways.<BR><BR>
WHAT RESEMBLANCE DO YOU SEE?<BR><BR>
You are not very aggressive<BR>
but I think you don't want me to notice that.<BR><BR>
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK I AM NOT VERY AGGRESSIVE?<BR><BR>
You don't argue with me.<BR><BR>
WHY DO YOU THINK I DON'T ARGUE WITH YOU?<BR><BR>
You are afraid of me.<BR><BR>
DOES IT PLEASE YOU TO BELIEVE I AM AFRAID OF YOU?<BR><BR>
My father is afraid of everybody.<BR><BR>
WHAT ELSE COMES TO YOUR MIND WHEN YOU THINK OF YOUR FATHER?<BR><BR>
Bullies.<BR><BR>
DOES THAT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE FACT<BR>
THAT YOUR BOYFRIEND MADE YOU COME HERE?<BR>
